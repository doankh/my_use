This document gives some guide lines how to make changes to USE and
how to work with PRCS.

1. Checking out a working copy from the repository.

 - Make sure the environment variable PRCS_REPOSITORY is set to the
   location of the central PRCS repository.
  
 - Change to an empty directory for your working copies of USE.

   % mkdir ~/use
   % cd ~/use

 - Checkout out the project files:
    
   % prcs checkout use

2. Making changes to files.
  
 - Edit existing files does not require any special steps.

 - If you add new files, you must also add entries for them to the
   project file "use.prj". You can do this with

   % prcs populate

 - If you remove new files, you must also remove entries for them
   from the project file "use.prj". You can do this with

   % prcs populate -d

   For reasons of readability, the file entries in "use.prj" are
   sorted alphabetically. This has to be done manually. Please
   maintain this ordering, when adding or deleting files. You can edit
   "use.prj" with a text editor. Just don't break the structure.

 - These steps can be done in any order and as often as you like.

3. Checking in your changes.

 - Make sure your changes don't break the build. Run a fresh build and
   all tests:

   % ant all

 - Document all changes that concern the user interface (in a broad
   sense) in the "NEWS" file. This is important for users who want to
   know what has changed between two releases.

 - For each changed file, add a short description to the "ChangeLog"
   file so that other people can understand what your changes are
   about. This can easily be done within emacs by typing "C-x 4 a"
   within the changed file's buffer.

 - Add an entry "* VERSION: 0.n" at the top of the "ChangeLog" file
   where n is the next minor number that will be assigned by PRCS to
   your checked-in version. Look at "use.prj" to determine n or at
   previos entries in "ChangeLog".

 - Checkin your changes and update all version identifiers.

   % prcs checkin
   % prcs rekey
